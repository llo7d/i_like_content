- Test request question based on the type of quiz & difficulty ( X )
-> Have code be as a question and display accordingly ( X )
-> Make it dynamic, if user changes to javascript etc..  ( X )
-> Add more questions for each type & return a random one ( )

- Test request questions based on the seen ids in chrome storage ( X )
-> Create .rpc ( X)
- Add/Remove urls ( X )
